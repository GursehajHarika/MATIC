    <h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Use case?</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Imagine selling a car on Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace, after agreeing with the buyer on how much they should pay you, the next step is to transfer ownership to the new owner. This is usually done by visiting a governing 
      body which issues and regualtes motor vehicles in your area, in Ontario this can be completed by visiting Service Ontario.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">All this sounds relatively normal and is how articles of ownership have been transacted for decades. However, there are a few flaws with this methodology. The first is receiving payment. In the event that one party does not 
      want to pay the agreed amount there is no easy way of stopping the transaction. This is handled wihtin the smart contract. Smart contracts will disallow the transaction if one or both parties do not hold their end of the bargin. For example, Bob agrees 
      to pay Alice $100 for a textbook. Bob only sends $99 to Alice and therefore causes the contract to terminate. Alice keeps her textbook and the funds are returned to Bob. We can already see how smart contracts help to protect both parties in this 
      situation. The smart contract acts as an intermediary between both parties ensuring that all conditions are met before completing the transaction. 
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">The second benefit is an increased level of reliability and speed. Users will no longer need to visit a physical
      location and are able to transact almost instantly.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Lastly, the main idea behind an NFT or Non-Fungible-Token is the idea that users can undeniably prove that this user owns this specific NFT and that it has not been modified in anyway shape or form. Ideally,

      of a third-party's approval.</p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 30px ">Why?</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">The current implementation of transferring ownership is costly and slow. Our objective is to allow users to transact digital documents using IPFS and issue authenticity certificates in the form of NFT’s 
      on the Polygon Testnet. Blockchains introduce the idea of a decentralized network where no one party is capable of controlling the data, in order for the network to go offline a malicious actor would need to control a majority of the nodes. 
      This allows users to be in full control of their data and minimizes risks associated with data breaches. In a centralized network, there is a single point of failure, if the data center is compromised all data on that network are now at risk. 
      In comparison to a decentralized network if a user’s wallet is compromised it does not affect other users on the network. </p>      
    <h3 style="padding-left: 30px">What is the Matic File System?</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px">Matic File System allows users to transact digital documents by creating an NFT every time a file is uploaded. All files are uploaded to IPFS which is a decentralized file storage system. After succesfully uploading,
